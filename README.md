# marcat-maker
official repo for the $marcat

i was the dev of $marcat maker (600k ath) about 4 months ago

i decided to relaunch it as marcat maker 2. bigger, better, and with actual tech behind it.

dedicated x: [@marcatmaker](https://x.com/marcatmaker) 

how does the tech work?
Grok receives api instructions to build a post.
that post is then sent to ChatGPT, which generates the perfect image using the main character.

how things will evolve between the two ais? no idea. but they will run autonomously with zero human intervention.

the code is on github.
